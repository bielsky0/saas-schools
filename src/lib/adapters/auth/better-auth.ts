 * (D71), and clicking into that academy's own host has never seen their
 * cookie. `createOrganizationAction`/`acceptInvitationAction` mint the token;
 * this endpoint is the ONLY place that redeems it.
 *
 * A CUSTOM ENDPOINT, NOT A HAND-ROLLED ROUTE HANDLER, because
 * `ctx.context.internalAdapter.createSession` + `setSessionCookie` is the exact
 * mechanism the built-in `magic-link` plugin uses to turn a redeemed token into
 * a session — reusing it means the cookie's name, attributes and signature come
 * from the same code as every other sign-in, so host-scoping (D70) holds
 * automatically instead of being re-implemented here.
 *
 * ⚠️ PREFETCH SAFETY IS THE FIRST CHECK, BEFORE THE TOKEN IS EVEN LOOKED AT. A
 * browser speculative prefetch (or a mail/Slack link-scanner) can hit this GET
 * endpoint before the user's real click, consuming the token and leaving the
 * genuine click with nothing to redeem — which would look like exactly the bug
 * this phase fixes. If this request already carries a valid Better Auth session
 * for THIS host, that means a previous hit already succeeded (prefetch or the
 * user's own reload), so this request just rides that session to `/dashboard`
 * and never touches `staff_session_handoff` — the token stays available for
 * whichever request actually needs it. `Sec-Purpose`/`Purpose: prefetch` is a
 * second, narrower net for the case a session does not exist yet: prefetches
 * get a `204` and the token is left untouched.
 *
 * Any other outcome (missing/expired/already-consumed token, OR a token
 * redeemed on a host other than the academy it was minted for) is a QUIET
 * redirect to `/login` on this same host — never an error page. The user can
 * always fall back to a normal sign-in, so a broken-looking response would be
 * a strictly worse outcome than silence.
