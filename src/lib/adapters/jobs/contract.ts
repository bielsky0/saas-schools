/**
 * Background-jobs contract (spec 1.2, 12 — pluggable async/scheduler backend).
 *
 * Feature code depends ONLY on this interface. Concrete adapters live beside this
 * file and are chosen by the factory in `./index.ts`. No provider SDK is imported
 * here.
 *
 * ── THE TRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX, AND WHY `enqueue` TAKES A WRITER ──────────────
 *
 * `enqueue` ALWAYS writes a row through `writer`; the ADAPTER is the thing that
 * drains. The postgres adapter drains by executing the handler locally. A future
 * Inngest adapter would drain by calling `inngest.send()` per row — it would NOT
 * change `enqueue`.
 *
 * This is the whole design, and it is load-bearing. The obvious "simplification"
 * — having an Inngest adapter's `enqueue` call `inngest.send()` directly — looks
 * cleaner and silently destroys atomicity: `inngest.send()` is an HTTP call, so a
 * caller whose transaction later rolls back has already sent the email. The
 * outbox is what lets this contract require `writer` without lying about it.
 *
 * Pass a `tx` and the job commits — or rolls back — WITH your business write.
 * That is what makes `features/billing/webhooks.ts` correct: the enqueue joins
 * the same transaction as the idempotency marker and inherits its exactly-once
 * guarantee for free.
 *
 * ── AT-LEAST-ONCE, NEVER EXACTLY-ONCE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `runAt` is a visibility timeout (see the `job` table header), so a job whose
 * worker appears to have died is re-claimed. "Appears" is doing real work there:
 * a job that is genuinely still running at CLAIM_TIMEOUT gets claimed a second
 * time. HANDLERS MUST BE IDEMPOTENT (§12.2). A reader who assumes exactly-once
 * will write a handler that double-sends, and it will only show up in production.
 *
 * ── PAYLOADS ARE JSON PRIMITIVES ONLY ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `payload` round-trips through jsonb, which is UNTYPED on the way back: a `Date`
 * goes in and an ISO STRING comes out, with the TypeScript type still cheerfully
 * claiming `Date`. Put ISO strings in, and have every handler zod-parse its
 * payload before touching it (`z.coerce.date()` on the way out). The type here is
 * a convenience for the caller, not a guarantee for the handler.
 */

/**
 * Minimal surface shared by `db` and a transaction handle, so a caller can pass
 * either — the same trick `features/admin/audit.ts` uses for its `Writer`.
 *
 * This couples the contract to Drizzle's `insert` shape, which is a real cost and
 * a deliberate one: the alternative is a hand-rolled interface that fakes an
 * abstraction over exactly one thing. Spec 11.1 asks for portability across
 * Postgres HOSTS, not across ORMs; Drizzle is a repo-wide substrate like `db`.
