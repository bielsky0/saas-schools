/**
 * The public page surface (spec §2.5, §9.1).
 *
 * ONE declaration with THREE consumers, because they were drifting apart the
 * moment there was more than one:
 *   - src/proxy.ts     — which pages are reachable without a session
 *   - src/app/sitemap.ts — which pages search engines should index
 *   - src/app/robots.ts  — which pages they should be told to skip
 *
 * `indexable` is required, not optional. "Reachable without a session" and
 * "should be in Google" are different questions that look like one question:
 * /login is the first, not the second. Making the field mandatory means adding a
 * public route without answering the SEO question is a type error rather than a
 * page that quietly ends up in search results.
 *
 * Only PAGES live here. The `/api/*` exemptions stay in proxy.ts: they are not
 * pages, they are never sitemap candidates, and their rationale is about
 * webhook signatures and cron bearer tokens, which has nothing to do with SEO.

 *
 * (see `hashQuery` in next/dist/esm/build/webpack/loaders/next-metadata-image-loader.js).

 * additionally appends a short hash to the segment (`opengraph-image-a1b2c3`,
