/**
 * Credit — the only settlement currency in langlion (§0 Zasada nadrzędna #2, §2.4).
 *
 * Every reservation reduces to the same event no matter how it was paid for:
 * one unit of this table is consumed. Cash at the desk, a card online, a
 * subscription renewal, an admin's goodwill, a cancellation refund — all six
 * `source` values produce the same row, and the booking path has exactly one
 * thing to do rather than six. That is what makes a single audit trail possible
 * instead of parallel mechanisms that agree only most of the time.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES ARE CREATED AND CONSUMED IN THE SAME TRANSACTION and never sit in a
 * wallet: `online_payment` (US-5.1/AC1, F11) and `on_site_payment` (US-6.1/AC1,
 * F6). They exist as rows because the ledger should record how the seat was paid
 * for, not because anyone ever chooses to spend them — hence US-7.6/AC3, where
 * such a payment leaves the parent's balance at zero.
 *
 * `athleteId` NULL is the FAMILY WALLET (§2.4, US-7.4): spendable on any of that
 * parent's children. A set value reserves the credit for one child. FIFO
 * consumption prefers the specific match over the family one (US-7.4/AC2), which
 * is why `consume.ts` orders on that expression rather than filtering on it.
 *
 * `validUntil` IS AN INSTANT, NOT A CALENDAR DATE, and this is a deliberate
 * departure from §1.2's "date" (decyzja D47). The spec's rule is "end of the
 * calendar month in `organization.timezone`" (US-1.2/AC3), so the zone has to be
 * applied somewhere. Applying it ONCE, when the credit is issued, turns expiry
 * into a single global `validUntil <= now()` comparison; storing a bare date
 * would push the zone into every reader, and the expiry sweep — which spans every
 * academy at once and therefore has no single zone — would compare a local date
 * against a UTC clock and expire credits up to a day early or late depending on
 * the tenant. Silently, because an early expiry looks exactly like a correct one.
 *
 * `creditPurchaseId` links back to the purchase that issued this credit. Since
 * F12, this is a real FK to `credit_purchase`.
 *
 * Unions are stored as `text` per repo convention (no `pgEnum`), validated in
 * `features/credits/schema.ts`.
