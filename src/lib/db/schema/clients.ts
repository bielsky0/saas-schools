/**
 * Client — a parent, as a fully domain-owned identity (langlion §1.2 rewizja 14.1,
 * §2.19).
 *
 * THIS IS A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to "reuse what the boilerplate provides"
 * (Zasada nadrzędna #5) — the fourth of four, alongside the Notification Center,
 * plans-as-data, and Stripe Connect. Parents do NOT get a boilerplate
 * `user`/`membership` row in any form.
 *
 * The reason is a hard business requirement, not a technical preference: from a
 * client's point of view, Academy A and Academy B are unrelated businesses.
 * Hence uniqueness on `(organizationId, email)` rather than globally — the same
 * address at two academies is two unconnected records, and a person who is a
 * client of both has two logins. A shared account would be a smaller schema and
 * the wrong product.
 *
 * Authentication is a domain OTP scoped to `(organizationId, email)`, so a code
 * issued by Academy A is useless at Academy B. Staff continue to use Better Auth
 * unchanged; the two session mechanisms are separate on purpose. The token table
 * and the session design arrive in F3 — this is only the identity row.
 *
 * `isVerified` false means the row was created by the registration upsert before
 * the OTP was confirmed (US-4.1). Recognition that shortcuts the signup form
 * requires `true` AND a match within the same organization (US-4.2/AC1).
