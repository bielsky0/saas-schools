/**
 * Constant security headers (spec 22.1).
 *
 * ─── Why this is its own module ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It has ZERO imports, and must keep zero. `next.config.ts` imports it, and Next
 * transpiles that file with a loader that does NOT resolve the `@/*` tsconfig
 * alias — an aliased import anywhere in the reachable graph fails the build with
 * `Cannot find module './src/...'`. `./csp.ts` reads env and so cannot be
 * imported there; these four values need nothing, so they live apart and both
 * sides import them.
 *
 * ─── Why these four are not set in the proxy ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are constant, and the proxy's matcher skips every path containing a dot:
 * `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/.well-known/*` and all of `public/`. Set here
 * and applied via next.config's `headers()`, they reach every response. The CSP
 * cannot join them — it carries a per-request nonce. See ./csp.ts.
