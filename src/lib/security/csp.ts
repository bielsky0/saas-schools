/**
 * Security headers and Content Security Policy (spec 22.1) — pure, edge-safe.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-light for the same reason
 * `src/lib/i18n/config.ts` is: it is imported by `src/proxy.ts`, which runs on
 * every request. It builds strings. It touches no React, no database, no adapter.
 *
 * ─── Why the CSP lives in the proxy and the other four headers do not ────────
 *
 * The CSP carries a per-request nonce, so it can only be built where the request
 * is — the proxy. The other four are constant, and constants belong in
 * `next.config.ts`, because the proxy's matcher skips every path containing a dot
 * (`/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/.well-known/*`, all of `public/`). Splitting
 * them this way is what makes "global" actually global.
 *
 * They must NOT both set the CSP. Two `Content-Security-Policy` response headers
 * are INTERSECTED by the browser, so a nonce-less copy in next.config.ts would
 * veto the nonced one from here and blank the site — a failure that looks like a
 * build problem and is really a header problem.
 *
 * ─── Why a nonce rather than 'unsafe-inline' or hashes ───────────────────────
 *
 * The usual objection to nonces is that they force dynamic rendering. That cost
 * is already paid here: `ImpersonationBanner` reads the session in the root
 * layout, so no page under `[locale]` is statically prerendered (confirmed
 * against .next/prerender-manifest.json). A strict policy is therefore free, and
 * `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` — which would defeat most of the point of having a
 * CSP at all — is not a trade we have to make.

     * A nonce was tried first and does not work, for a specific reason: `sonner`
     * (the toast library, rendered from the root layout) injects its stylesheet
     * with a hardcoded `__insertCSS` helper — `createElement("style")`, append,
     * then set the text — and exposes no nonce option in 2.0.7. Under a nonced
     * style-src the browser blocks it TWICE (once empty on append, once filled),
     * and every toast in the app renders unstyled. Verified in a real browser,
     * not assumed.
     *
     * Rejected alternatives:
     *   - Hashes for those two blocks: they change on any sonner CSS edit, so a
     *     routine patch bump would silently unstyle every toast. A policy that
     *     breaks quietly on upgrade is worse than one that is honestly looser.
     *   - style-src-attr: tested, does not apply — these are <style> ELEMENTS.
     *   - Keeping the nonce alongside 'unsafe-inline': pointless. Per CSP3 a
     *     nonce or hash in a directive makes 'unsafe-inline' IGNORED, so that
     *     combination is exactly today's broken behaviour with extra characters.
     *
     * What this does NOT weaken: `script-src` stays strict and nonced. That is
     * the XSS boundary. Inline STYLE permits CSS-based tricks (selector-driven
     * exfiltration of attribute values, overlay/clickjacking within a page that
     * frame-ancestors already refuses to frame) — real, and far below arbitrary
     * script execution.
     *
     * Revisit when sonner accepts a nonce; this becomes `'nonce-${nonce}'` and
     * nothing else in the file changes.
