/**
 * Season generation for Schedule-First (langlion §2.2, EPIK 3).
 *
 * Saving a recurring pattern generates its season; there is no separate
 * "Generate" button (US-3.1/AC1). Two callers share the function below, and they
 * differ only in where the tenant context comes from:
 *
 *   - the action, INLINE in its own transaction, for `isRecurring=false` — which
 *     must produce exactly one session synchronously (US-3.1/AC2);
 *   - the job handler at the bottom, in a context it opens itself, for a season.
 *
 * Sharing one function is the point. Two implementations of "expand a pattern
 * into rows" would drift on exactly the details that are hard to see: which
 * location is inherited, whether the unique constraint is targeted, what happens
 * to a trainer collision.
 */

/**
 * Why the outcome is a report and not a thrown error.
 *
 * A season is dozens of rows and two things can legitimately refuse ONE of them
 * while the rest are fine: the pattern was already generated (§4.4 unique →
 * 23505, which is what makes extending a season idempotent, US-3.2/AC2), or the
 * trainer is already teaching at that instant (§5.1 exclusion → 23P01). Aborting
 * the whole batch for either would be wrong in opposite directions — the first is
 * not a failure at all, and the second would let one collision in week 12 cancel
 * the other 29 weeks.
 *
 * The same partial-success shape the spec asks for in §3.4/AC7 and §2.11 (mass
 * trainer reassignment). Nothing here silently swallows a collision: it is
 * counted, logged, and handed back for the caller to show.

 * Expand one pattern into `class_session` rows.
 *
 * `tx` must already carry the tenant context; this function never opens one,
 * because its two callers acquire it differently and one of them needs the
 * inserts to be atomic with its own writes.
 *
 * PER-ROW SAVEPOINTS, not per-row transactions. `tx.transaction()` inside an open
 * transaction opens a SAVEPOINT (see `withOwner`'s header, decyzja D15), so a
 * refused insert rolls back only itself and leaves `tx` usable — which is what
 * makes "skip this one occurrence" expressible at all. Without the savepoint the
 * first 23P01 would poison the enclosing transaction and every subsequent
 * statement would fail with 25P02, turning one collision into a total failure
 * that LOOKS like a collision.
 *
 * The tenant GUC survives savepoint release (D15 again), so the nested handle is
 * still scoped to the same organization.
