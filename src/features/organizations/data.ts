 * never writes ad-hoc queries. Reference implementation for owner-scoped access.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF FUNCTION LIVE HERE SINCE F1a, and the difference is visible in
 * the signature:
 *
 * - Functions touching a table under RLS (`membership`, `invitation`) take a
 *   `TenantDb` as their first parameter. Calling one without opening
 *   `withTenant` is then a compile error rather than a silently empty result.
 * - Functions touching tables outside RLS (`organization`, `personal_account`,
 *   `user`) keep using `db` directly. Both owner TARGETS are outside RLS by
 *   construction — a policy keyed on the owner cannot apply to the row that
 *   defines it; see the header of `src/lib/db/schema/index.ts`.
 *
 * Reads that cannot name a tenant at all live in `./cross-tenant.ts`.
