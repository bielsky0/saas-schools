/**
 * What a parent may pay with, for one offer (F5; §2.13, §2.25, US-4.4, US-23.4).
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested, because this is a MATRIX and matrices are where a browser
 * test proves one cell and leaves five unproven. Three independent facts decide
 * the answer:
 *   1. `allowedPurchaseModes` — may this offer be bought one class at a time at
 *      all, or only as a package? (§2.13)
 *   2. `paymentPolicy` — which methods has the academy chosen to accept? (§1.2)
 *   3. `onlineAvailable` — can online payments physically be taken right now?
 *
 * FACT 3 IS NOT FACT 2, and conflating them is the mistake this shape exists to
 * prevent. "The academy does not accept online payment" is a settled decision and
 * the option should simply not appear (US-4.4/AC3). "The academy accepts it but
 * Stripe is not connected" is a temporary state with a fix, so the option appears
 * DISABLED with a reason — the same treatment §2.25 already specifies for the
 * admin side of Constraint 7. Different facts, different copy.
 *
 * In F5 `onlineAvailable` is always `false`: Stripe Connect is F10 and the online
 * checkout is F11, so no organisation can take a card yet. It is a parameter
 * rather than a hardcoded branch precisely so those phases change a call site and
 * not this logic.
