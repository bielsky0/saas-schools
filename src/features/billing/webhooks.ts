/**
 * Webhook processing (spec 5.4 — idempotent, signed provider events).
 *
 * This is where subscription state is DERIVED — never guessed from a browser
 * redirect (spec 5.3). Not `actions.ts`: a webhook is not a server action, it
 * has no session and no role, and its only authorization is the signature the
 * adapter already verified.
 *
 * Reference pattern for receiving a provider webhook — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
 *
 * ROW-LEVEL SECURITY (F1b). The four billing tables came under RLS, which splits
 * this file in two. RESOLVING the owner cannot be scoped — a provider customer id
 * names no tenant until it is mapped — so `findBillingCustomer` lives in
 * `./cross-tenant.ts` behind the documented bypass, and is the only bypass here.
 * Everything AFTER that runs inside `withOwner`, so `WITH CHECK` stays
 * load-bearing on this path: it is the only externally-driven write path in the
 * application, and the place where a mis-resolved owner would do real damage.
 * That is why this module is deliberately NOT on the `@/lib/db/system`
 * allow-list — see the "WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT EXEMPT" list in eslint.config.mjs.
 *
 * THREE `ON CONFLICT` SEMANTICS UNDER RLS, measured rather than assumed, because
 * all three of this file's guarantees depend on them:
 *   - the marker's `DO NOTHING` is evaluated against the INSERT `WITH CHECK`
 *     ONLY; a conflicting row that is invisible under `USING` makes it return no
 *     row exactly as before, so duplicate detection is unchanged;
 *   - `setWhere` is evaluated BEFORE the `USING` check, so a stale event still
 *     returns zero rows without raising — the `applied.length === 0` watermark
 *     signal below means precisely what it always did;
 *   - but a FRESH event whose customer owner disagrees with the owner already
 *     stored on the row now raises `42501` ("the UPDATE path will never be
 *     silently avoided") instead of quietly overwriting another tenant's row with
 *     this one's data. That is the intended trade: loud beats silent. It surfaces
 *     as a 500 and a provider retry, and F1b's data gate is what proves no such
 *     row exists. Note the asymmetry — a STALE event with the same mismatch is
 *     swallowed as stale, so the error is not a reliable detector of the state.
 *
 * The pre-image read in `applySubscriptionEvent` is owner-scoped for free as a
 * result, which is what the §6.4 audit diff should always have been.
 */

 * Owner columns as they sit on `billing_customer`; exactly one is non-null.

 * makes that safe under out-of-order delivery: an event older than what we have
 * applied is dropped, so a late `updated` cannot resurrect a cancelled
 * subscription. It also fixes `updated`-before-`created`, which a bare UPDATE

 *   - a CONCURRENT redelivery blocks on the unique index until the first
 *     transaction commits, then also finds a conflict and skips;
 *   - if applying the effect throws, the marker rolls back WITH it, so the
 *     provider's retry reprocesses cleanly instead of being permanently
 *     swallowed by a marker for work that never happened.
 *
 * Infrastructure failures are intentionally left to propagate: a 5xx tells the
 * provider to retry, which is exactly right for a transient fault.
 *
 * NOTIFICATIONS (spec 10.2) ARE ENQUEUED INSIDE THIS TRANSACTION, and the enqueue
 * is a plain INSERT precisely so that it can be. Sending mail here instead would
 * break in three ways, none of them obvious:
 *   - it is not transactional. If the send succeeds and the transaction THEN rolls
 *     back, the marker rolls back with it, the provider retries, the marker
 *     inserts — and the mail goes out twice. Rare and unreproducible, which is
 *     worse than common;
 *   - it holds a pooled connection open across an HTTP call to the email provider.
 *     That is the deadlock features/admin/audit.ts documents, with an outage as
 *     the trigger: on the small default pool, a provider timing out plus a webhook
 *     burst wedges the whole app;
 *   - it makes webhook latency depend on the email provider. Stripe times out
 *     around 20s and retries, so a slow provider MANUFACTURES the redeliveries
 *     that then hit the first problem.
 * The enqueue has none of these and inherits the marker's exactly-once guarantee
 * for free. The drain happens after the response, from the route.
