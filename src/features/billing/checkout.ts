 * THE ORDERING INVARIANT (documented on `schema/billing-customers.ts`): the
 * provider customer is created and its mapping PERSISTED before any checkout
 * session exists. That is what lets the webhook treat an unresolvable customer as
 * "not ours" and ignore it, instead of retrying forever against a row that was
 * never written. Reversing these two steps produces a race that only shows up
 * under real provider latency, so it is enforced here in one place rather than
 * trusted to each caller.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: grant access. The success redirect only
 * brings the browser back; entitlement follows from the webhook (spec 5.3 — the
 * user can close the tab before ever being redirected). Nothing here writes a
 * subscription row.
