/**
 * Audit trail writer (spec 6.3 → 6.4).
 *
 * Records who did what to whom, and when, for every critical action — originally
 * super-admin panel operations (§6.3), now widened to ordinary tenant mutations
 * (§6.4). The table is append-only: nothing here updates or deletes.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE CALL SITES, AND NOT THE DATA-ACCESS LAYER ──────────────────────
 *
 * §6.4 asks for the audit hook to live in the data-access layer so that "no new
 * feature can forget to log". We do not do that, and the reason is worth stating
 * because the spec is explicit: a generic hook at the write layer can see that a
 * row changed, but not WHY — it cannot distinguish a role change from a soft
 * delete from a slug rename, and it cannot name a target label a human will read
 * six months later. It produces a diff log, not an audit log.
 *
 * The substitute guarantee is the type system: `organizationId` on `AuditEntry`
 * is REQUIRED and non-optional, so a call site cannot silently omit its tenant —
 * it must write `null` and mean it. Adding a field to `AuditEntry` breaks every
 * call site until each one is considered. That is a weaker guarantee than §6.4
 * asked for and a stronger one than a comment, and it is the trade we chose.
 *
 * ─── The two write rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two kinds of admin effect, and they need different orderings. Pick by
 * asking "who owns the database connection the effect runs on?"
 *
 * RULE A — the effect is OURS (soft-deleting a user/org): write the audit row in
 * the SAME transaction as the effect. This is the `webhook_event` precedent: an
 * effect that commits without its ledger row is a failure you cannot detect later.
 *
 *     await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
 *       await tx.update(user).set({ deletedAt: now })…;
 *       await recordAudit(tx, { action: "user.delete", … });
 *     });
 *
 * RULE B — the effect is the AUTH ENGINE'S (impersonate, suspend, unsuspend,
 * setSuperAdmin): a shared transaction is IMPOSSIBLE. `auth.api.banUser` runs
 * through the engine's own internal adapter on its own connection; there is no
 * supported way to hand it our `tx`. So: write the audit row first, in its own
 * transaction, THEN call the effect. Fail closed.
 *
 *     await recordAudit(db, { action: "impersonation.start", … });
 *     const result = await adminAuthAdapter.impersonate(targetId, await headers());
 *
 * The consequences, chosen deliberately:
 *   - audit write throws  → we never impersonate. Acceptance criterion 2 holds
 *     even under failure, which is the whole point of the ordering.
 *   - effect then throws  → a spurious row. THE LOG RECORDS AUTHORIZED INTENT
 *     AND OVER-LOGS RATHER THAN UNDER-LOGS. A row for an action that didn't
 *     happen is a puzzle; a missing row for one that did is a breach you can't see.
 *   - for impersonation this is the only correct order regardless: the effect
 *     swaps the session cookie and the action then redirect()s (which throws), so
 *     auditing afterwards leaves a window with a swapped cookie and no row.
 *
 * RULE A, THE LABEL-LOOKUP COROLLARY: an entry needs a `targetLabel` (an email,
 * a slug) that the mutating code often does not have in scope — a role change
 * knows `userId`, not the email an auditor will read. Do that lookup with the
 * SAME `tx`, never with `db`:
 *
 *     await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
 *       await tx.update(membership).set({ role })…;
 *       const [target] = await tx.select({ email: user.email }).from(user)…;  // tx!
 *       await recordAudit(tx, { …, targetLabel: target.email });
 *     });
 *
 * This does NOT contradict the deadlock warning below. The hazard there is taking
 * a SECOND pooled connection while holding an open transaction; `tx.select` runs
 * on the connection you already hold. A `db.select` inside the transaction is the
 * bug — it blocks on the pool while the pool waits on you.
 *
 * CONSIDERED AND REJECTED for Rule B: wrapping the engine call inside an open
 * `db.transaction` so the row commits iff the effect succeeded. It works, and it
 * is tempting. But it holds a pooled connection open across a nested call that
 * takes a SECOND connection from the same pool — a deadlock under the small
 * default pool `postgres(env.DATABASE_URL)` gives us. Not worth it for an action
 * a human performs a handful of times a day.
 *
 * Rule B applies to all four engine-effect actions even where a spurious row is
 * uglier (a phantom "suspend" reads worse than a phantom "impersonate"):
 * consistency beats per-action cleverness in the module auditors read first.
 */

/**
 * Every audited action (spec 6.3 + 6.4). Neutral vocabulary — never a vendor
 * error/event string.
 *
 * NAMING: lowercase dotted, not the SCREAMING_CASE of the §6.4 task doc. These
 * values are user-visible (both audit pages render `action` raw) and are asserted
 * on literally in e2e/admin-impersonation.spec.ts; renaming would also require
 * rewriting live rows for no benefit.
 *
 * On §6.3's "zmiana roli": BOTH halves now exist. superadmin.grant/revoke is the
 * SYSTEM role change (§6.1); member.role_change is the tenant one (§3/§4). The
 * §6.3-era version of this comment argued the tenant half did not belong in this
 * ledger — that was correct while the ledger was panel-only, and §6.4 is
 * precisely the requirement that changed it.
 *
 * DEFERRED — in the §6.4 task catalog, but the underlying feature does not exist.
 * Do not add the action without building the surface; an action name that nothing
 * ever writes is worse than an absent one, because it reads as coverage.
 *   - `data_export.request` / `consent.update`: no data-export feature and no
 *     consent record exist. (`notification_preferences` is a preference, not a
 *     consent — it carries no timestamped grant/withdraw semantics.)
 *   - self-serve `account.deletion_initiated`: only the ADMIN path exists, and it
 *     already logs as `user.delete`. A user cannot delete their own account yet.
 *   - `payment_method.update`: `BillingEventType` has no `payment_method.*` event
 *     and there is no billing-portal action to trigger one.
 *   - AI-agent writes (the task doc's AUTO_SCHEDULE_UPDATED): features/mcp
 *     registers read-only tools only. The `AIAgent` actor plumbing IS built
 *     (`mcpActor` below) so the first write tool has nothing to invent.
 * Extension point for all five: add the name here, then call `recordAudit` in the
 * same transaction as the write (Rule A).
