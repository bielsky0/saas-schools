/**
 * Path prefixes an academy's CMS page may not claim (CMS spec §2.1, US-C1.2).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS`, AND MERGING THE TWO IS A BUG THAT LOOKS
 * LIKE TIDYING (D58). They answer to different authorities:
 *
 *   - `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS` (src/lib/validation/primitives.ts) holds DNS LABELS
 *     the platform's own infrastructure answers on — `www`, `mail`, `smtp`,
 *     `cdn`. It is read only at write time, by the organization form, and it is
 *     a ONE-WAY RATCHET: once an academy has printed its address on a flyer,
 *     reclaiming the name is not a migration we can perform.
 *   - This list holds FIRST PATH SEGMENTS the Next router already owns. It is
 *     read at RUNTIME, by the proxy, on every request to a tenant host, and it
 *     is free to grow whenever the app gains a top-level route.
 *
 * The two overlap on `api` and `admin`. That is a coincidence, not a relation:
 * `smtp` has no reason to be a forbidden page slug, and `zapisy` has no reason
 * to be a forbidden subdomain. Merged, every future edit to one list would
 * silently restate the rule of the other — and one of them cannot be walked back.
 *
 * ─── Why a collision is a validation error and not a runtime decision ────────
 *
 * A page saved with slug `dashboard` would save cleanly and then be permanently
 * unreachable, because the app router claims that path first. The symptom
 * (page invisible) sits far from the cause (slug choice), which is exactly the
 * kind of failure a write-time check is for. Hence one list, two consumers:
 * `reservedPrefixOf` for the proxy and `isReservedSlug` for slug validation.

/**
 * Which host serves a reserved prefix (D60, widened in F4.6).
 *
 *   - "tenant" — means something only inside an academy. On the apex the proxy
 *     forwards it so the app router answers 404, rather than sending an
 *     anonymous visitor to log in to a page that still would not exist.
 *   - "apex"   — platform surface. On an academy host the proxy hops to the
 *     apex; without that hop `/admin` on a tenant host would fall through to
 *     default-deny and redirect to `/login` ON THAT HOST, where the Better Auth
 *     cookie does not exist — a login loop with no message explaining it.
 *   - "both"   — the same path means different things on the two hosts and is
 *     legitimate on each. Added by F4.6 for the staff panel and the auth surface.
 *
 * ⚠️ "both" IS NOT A CONVENIENCE, IT IS THE SAFE FORM OF WHAT F4.6 ORIGINALLY
 * PLANNED. The earlier note here proposed flipping `dashboard`/`login`/`logout`
 * to "tenant". That is wrong, and the reason is worth stating precisely because
 * the obvious guess overstates it.
 *
 * The apex branch in src/proxy.ts returns `forward()` EARLY for "tenant"-stage
 * prefixes, which SKIPS `isPublicBarePage` and default-deny below it.
 *
 * ⚠️ UPDATED IN F5 / F2 — WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE HAS CHANGED. It used to be safe by
 * accident: the only "tenant" prefix was `zapisy`, which had NO ROUTE, so the
 * early return happened to 404. F5 built `/zapisy/[groupTypeSlug]`, and F2
 * replaced it with the CMS resolver `(site)/zapisy/[[...slug]]` (mvp-plan F2),
 * so the accident is gone. It is now safe on purpose, and by exactly one thing:
 * that route calls `requireServedOrganization()` as its FIRST statement, which
 * `notFound()`s when no academy is served — the apex, a foreign host, or an
 * unknown subdomain alike.
 *
 * That call is load-bearing, not defensive. Removing it, or moving it below a
 * `params` read or a query, serves one academy's enrollment page on the apex with
 * no tenant resolved. Pinned by e2e/langlion-subdomain-routing.spec.ts.
 *
 * `/dashboard` HAS a route and no such guard at the edge, so the same path would
 * forward an anonymous request into the page — which is why it is "both".
 *
 * MEASURED CONSEQUENCE (mutation-tested, F4.6): the panel is NOT exposed, because
 * every page under it calls `requireSession`/`requireOrgAccess` itself — §4.2's
 * rule that the backend is the boundary is what saves it. What is actually lost
 * is (a) the edge guard as a first line, so any future route added under this
 * prefix without its own check would be served, and (b) locale preservation: the
 * page-level redirect answers `/login?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard` instead of the
 * proxy's `/en/login?callbackUrl=%2Fen%2Fdashboard`, so a Polish reader is
 * bounced into an English login and returned to an English page.
 *
 * "both" falls through on both hosts and therefore stays behind the guard on
 * both. Pinned by an e2e test that a mutation to "tenant" must break (see
 * e2e/langlion-subdomain-routing.spec.ts).
