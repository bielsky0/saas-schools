 * Academy A is not merely filtered out at Academy B — the row is not visible to
 * the query at all.
 *
 * ─── THE RESPONSE NEVER REVEALS WHETHER THE ADDRESS IS KNOWN ────────────────
 *
 * `issueOtp` reports the same success for a brand-new address, an existing
 * parent, and a rate-limited caller's first refusal. This costs nothing here,
 * unlike on a password login, because the upsert means every address that asks
 * BECOMES known (US-4.1) — there is no membership fact left to leak. The property
 * is worth keeping anyway: it is what stops this endpoint from being an oracle
 * for "is this parent enrolled at that academy".
