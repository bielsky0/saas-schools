/**
 * Data access for parent authentication (langlion §2.19 rewizja 14.1, plan F3).
 *
 * Same two conventions as every langlion DAL: a `TenantDb` handle, so a caller
 * without tenant context is a compile error rather than an empty result, and an
 * explicit `organizationId` predicate that RLS backs up rather than replaces.
 *
 * ─── WHY SO MANY OF THESE ARE ONE STATEMENT ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three functions here (`consumeOtp`, `registerFailedAttempt`, `touchSession`)
 * are deliberately single UPDATEs with their conditions in the WHERE clause,
 * never a read followed by a write. A credential check that reads state, decides
 * in TypeScript, and then writes is a TOCTOU window: two requests carrying the
 * same code both observe `consumedAt IS NULL` before either commits, and both
 * proceed. Being inside a transaction does not close that window — READ COMMITTED
 * lets both snapshots see the un-consumed row.
 *
 * This is the same reasoning as `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on credit consumption
 * (F4) and `FOR UPDATE` on session capacity (§5.2), and the same principle as
 * Zasada nadrzędna #3: the guarantee lives in the database, not in the order the
 * application happens to do things.

/**
 * Find-or-create the parent for `(organizationId, email)` — the US-4.1 upsert.
 *
 * PRODUCTION BEHAVIOUR, NOT A TEST SEAM: the spec has the registration form
 * create the client BEFORE the code is verified, which is why `isVerified`
 * defaults to false and why recognition (US-4.2/AC1) requires `true` rather than
 * mere existence. Issuing a code for an address nobody has used yet therefore
 * creates a row, by design.
 *
 * `DO UPDATE` rather than `DO NOTHING` only so that RETURNING yields the row on
 * the conflict path too — `DO NOTHING` returns nothing, which would force a
 * second round trip. Touching `updatedAt` is the cheapest write that keeps the
 * statement a genuine upsert.
 *
 * Safe under RLS despite the F1b finding that `DO UPDATE` raises 42501 on a row
 * invisible to USING: the conflicting row is by construction in this tenant, both
 * because `organizationId` is part of the unique key and because the caller is
 * already inside `withTenant` for that same organization.
