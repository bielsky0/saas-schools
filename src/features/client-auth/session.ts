/**
 * The parent session (langlion §2.19, plan F3 / decyzja D37).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT Better Auth. Staff and parents are different populations with
 * different lifecycles — see `schema/clients.ts` for why parents are a domain
 * entity at all — and one session mechanism serving both would have to blur the
 * boundary this phase exists to draw. `requireClient` is to a parent what
 * `requireOrgPermission` is to a staff member, and nothing in this file grants
 * access to the staff dashboard.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THE COOKIE IS AND IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is an opaque 256-bit random token, and nothing else. It carries no client
 * id, no organization id, and no signature, because it makes no claim: the ROW
 * holds the facts and the token is only a lookup key. The practical consequence
 * is that revocation works — deleting the row ends the session immediately, which
 * a self-describing signed cookie could not offer before its own expiry.
 *
 * Only the SHA-256 is stored, like `invitation.tokenHash`. A database leak yields
 * hashes, not usable sessions.
 *
 * ─── ONE COOKIE NAME, NOT ONE PER ORGANIZATION ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The name is fixed and the organization lives on the row. The bet was that this
 * keeps the cookie contract identical before and after the subdomain middleware,
 * with per-host scoping arriving on its own. F4.5 collected: academies now live
 * on separate hosts, the browser keeps one cookie per host by default, and THIS
 * FILE DID NOT CHANGE.
 *
 * The interim cost is also gone. Signing in to Academy B used to overwrite the
 * cookie for Academy A, because both sat on one host — so a browser held one
 * academy at a time. It now holds as many as it visits, which is asserted in
 * `e2e/langlion-subdomain-routing.spec.ts`. It was never an isolation hole
 * either way: `resolveClientSession` looks the token up inside the served tenant,
 * so a foreign cookie finds no row.

 * Start a session and set the cookie. Route Handlers and Server Functions only —

 *
 * ─── INVARIANT: THIS IS THE ONLY CALL SITE ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `createClientSession` is called in exactly ONE place:
 * `/api/client-auth/verify/route.ts` — after `consumeOtp` succeeded and
 * `markClientVerified` flipped `isVerified=true`, inside the same transaction.
 * A session therefore means "the bearer has verified ownership of this email
 * address at this academy through a consumed OTP", and nothing else.
 *
 * If you add a second path to create a session (e.g. staff impersonation,
 * magic link), you MUST either:
 *   a. add an explicit `isVerified` gate at that call site, OR
 *   b. audit every endpoint that trusts session == identity (password set,
 *      profile write, athlete CRUD) and add explicit `isVerified` checks.
 *
 * The `POST /api/client-auth/password` endpoint already has such a check
 * as defense-in-depth (Faza 29a).
