/**
 * Rate-limit policy for parent authentication (langlion plan F3, spec §22.3).
 *
 * The proxy already counts every `/api` request at the `write` tier, and that is
 * not enough here for the same reason it was not enough for sign-in (§2.1): a
 * generic per-IP ceiling says nothing about how many codes ONE inbox may receive,
 * and mailing a stranger twenty codes is abuse even from twenty addresses. So
 * these limits are applied inside the handlers, reached by a function call rather
 * than by a header sniff — the property `features/auth/actions.ts` documents for
 * the login path.
 *
 * ─── TWO DIMENSIONS, AND WHY BOTH ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Per-ADDRESS is the primary limit. It is the only one an attacker cannot dilute
 * by changing networks, and it is what bounds both inbox flooding and guessing at
 * a specific parent's code.
 *
 * Per-IP is the secondary one, deliberately looser. This audience sits behind
 * shared NATs — a school, an office, a mobile carrier — so a tight IP limit
 * mostly punishes bystanders. It exists to stop one host from sweeping many
 * addresses, which the per-address rule cannot see.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEITHER IS THE LAST LINE. The adapter FAILS OPEN when its store is
 * unavailable, which is right for a login form (a password still stands behind
 * it) and wrong for a six-digit code with nothing behind it. The cap that holds
 * regardless is `client_otp.attempts`, enforced in the UPDATE itself — see
 * `registerFailedAttempt`.
 *
 * KEYS ARE HASHED, mandatorily: the postgres provider writes them to a plain text
 * column, so a bare email address here would be PII at rest in a table with no
 * owner and no retention story of its own.
