/**
 * Route guard (spec 2.5) + locale routing (spec 16) + request-id minting
 * (spec 15.3) + CSP nonce (spec 22.1). Next 16's `proxy` convention (formerly
 * `middleware`).
 *
 * The guard is an OPTIMISTIC check: it only tests for the presence of a signed
 * session cookie so it stays fast and edge-safe (no DB or crypto). It is a UX
 * convenience, NOT the security boundary — every protected server
 * component/action independently calls `requireSession` from `src/lib/auth`,
 * which fully validates the session server-side (spec 4.2).
 *
 * ─── Why locale routing lives HERE and not in next-intl's middleware ─────────
 *
 * Because two systems cannot both own the response. next-intl's middleware wants
 * to rewrite/redirect for locale; this file must default-deny for auth. Composed
 * by hand, there is ONE ordering, written down, that both concerns read. Bolted
 * together, the interesting cases (a metadata image with no prefix, an /api route
 * that must not be prefixed, a login redirect that must keep one) land in
 * whichever ran first.
 *
 * It also keeps `localePrefix: "always"` honest: this file only ever REDIRECTS,
 * never rewrites, so the pathname the guard evaluated is always the pathname the
 * router serves. An `as-needed` scheme would need `rewrite("/" → "/en")`, and
 * then those two strings differ — which is precisely where an auth guard goes
 * wrong without anyone noticing.
 *
 * ─── Why the CSP does not get a branch of its own (spec 22.1) ────────────────
 *
 * Same principle, applied a second time. Spec 22.1 requires the header mechanism
 * to COMPOSE with this guard rather than compete with it, so the CSP is not a
 * decision in the flow below — it is attached by the three functions that
 * construct every response (`forward`, `redirectTo` and the terminal
 * `tooManyRequests`), exactly like the request id. The ordering above is
 * untouched, and there is no path out of this file that can forget the header,
 * because there is no path out of this file that does not go through one of
 * those three.
 *
 * ─── Rate limiting, the third concern (spec 22.3) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `tooManyRequests` is the only one of the three that TERMINATES rather than
 * continues, and it exists as a constructor for exactly the reason above: a
 * hand-rolled `NextResponse.json` in the flow would be the first path out of this
 * file that could forget the CSP and the request id, which would make the
 * paragraph above false.
 *
 * The policy — which endpoint gets which limit — is not here either. It lives in
 * src/lib/security/rate-limit.ts, the same way the CSP string lives in csp.ts,
 * so this file stays a list of decisions rather than a table of numbers.
 *
 * The four CONSTANT security headers are not here at all; they are in
 * next.config.ts, which also covers the dot-paths this proxy's matcher skips.
 * See src/lib/security/csp.ts for why that split exists.
 *
 * ─── Host resolution, the fourth concern (langlion §2.27, F4.5) ──────────────
 *
 * Academies live at `{subdomain}.langlion.pl`, so the tenant is in the `Host`
 * header. This file PARSES that header and publishes the label inward; it does
 * NOT look the organization up. That split is deliberate (D54): the paragraph at
 * the top of this file promises a guard that is fast and edge-safe with no DB,
 * and a lookup here would spend a database round-trip on every request the
 * matcher touches — including the apex, where no academy exists at all. Next's
 * own documentation says the same independently ("Proxy is not intended for slow
 * data fetching"). Whether the academy EXISTS is answered by the request layer,
 * via `servedOrganization()`.
 *
 * Consequence, stated plainly because it reads as a gap until you see it is the
 * design: this file cannot tell a real academy from a typo. Both forward, and
 * the unknown one 404s downstream (D57).
 *
 * The publication itself is in `forward()` rather than in the flow, for exactly
 * the reason the CSP is: the metadata-image escape is the FIRST return in this
 * function, and an academy's OG card is precisely a request that needs the
 * tenant. A step in the flow would miss it.

     * `(site)/zapisy/[[...slug]]`, mvp-plan F2), and holds because that route
     * opens with `requireServedOrganization()`, which `notFound()`s with no
     * academy served. Any future "tenant" prefix must carry
     * the same guarantee, in the page, not here.

     * A guarded prefix that has a route but NO such guard (`/dashboard`) must never
     * be "tenant": the request reaches the page, and although §4.2's own checks
     * still refuse it, the refusal comes from the page and therefore loses the
     * locale (`/login`, not `/en/login`). Measured, not assumed — see the note in
     * features/cms/reserved-slugs.ts. "both" falls through instead, which is why
