/**
 * Site-wide metadata defaults (spec §9.1).
 *
 * `metadataBase` is what lets every other page express `alternates.canonical`
 * and og:image as a root-relative path — without it Next cannot absolutise them
 * and silently drops the tags.
 *
 * The openGraph/twitter blocks here are DEFAULTS FOR NON-PUBLIC PAGES ONLY.
 * Metadata resolution replaces `openGraph` wholesale rather than merging it, and
 * Next only auto-fills a page's title into openGraph when the page declares an
 * openGraph object of its own (`inheritFromMetadata` in
 * next/dist/esm/lib/metadata/resolve-metadata.js). So a page that sets just
 * `title`/`description` inherits THIS og:title verbatim — every share card would
 * read "SaaS Boilerplate". Public pages must therefore go through
 * `pageMetadata()` in src/features/content/seo.ts, which always emits a complete
 * openGraph + twitter block. Never hand-write `export const metadata` on a page
 * that is reachable without a session.
 *
 * `og:locale` is now per-request, which is why this is `generateMetadata` and not
 * a static `metadata` object: a Polish page advertising `en_US` tells every
 * scraper the wrong thing.
