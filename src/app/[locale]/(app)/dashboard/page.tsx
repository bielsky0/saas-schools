 * home on a tenant host.

 * question is "was an academy host addressed at all", not "does that academy
 * exist" — the second returns null for a NONEXISTENT academy too, which would
 * serve the personal dashboard under every unclaimed `*.langlion.pl`. That exact
 * confusion shipped once in F4.5 and was caught by hand, not by a test.
 * `requireOrgAccess` inside `AcademyHome` then 404s an unknown academy.

 * navigation — `next/link` would attempt an RSC fetch across origins and fail.
 * More importantly it reflects what §2.19 exception #5 actually specifies: this

 * that changes the active tenant inside one session.
 *
 * The link points at the apex's handoff `start` endpoint (F5.6 / D74), which
 * mints a short-lived single-use token for THIS academy and forwards to that
 * host's `/api/auth/staff-handoff/verify`. `start` is where the apex session
 * cookie exists, so the bridge can be created there and redeemed on the academy
 * host — no per-academy login screen for someone already signed in. It must NOT
 * point straight at `{subdomain}/dashboard`: that path is guarded by the
 * proxy's default-deny (`"both"` stage, D67), and an unauthenticated request to
 * it on a host with no session cookie would be bounced to that host's `/login`
 * before any page code runs. `/api/auth/*` is the one path the proxy leaves open
 * without a session (`isPublicApiPath` in `src/proxy.ts`).
