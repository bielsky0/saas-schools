/**
 * Authenticated app shell (spec 7.4). Wraps both the apex account surface and an
 * academy's panel. `requireSession` is the authoritative guard. The personal
 * account is ensured on entry as a backfill for users created before the
 * registration hook existed (spec 3.1) — unconditionally in all three tenancy
 * modes, because in `disabled` the personal account IS the tenant, which makes it
 * more load-bearing, not less.
 *
 * THE ACCOUNT SWITCHER IS GONE (F4.6, §2.19 exception #5). Its replacement is a
 * directory on the apex dashboard, not a control in this navbar: an academy is a
 * separate origin requiring its own sign-in, so there is nothing to switch
 * between within one session. What the navbar shows instead is WHERE YOU ARE —
 * the academy's name on its host, the product name on the apex — because with
 * several academies open in several tabs, that is the question the header has to
 * answer.
