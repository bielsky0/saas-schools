/**
 * Job drain endpoint (spec 12) — THE DELIVERY GUARANTEE.
 *
 * `kickDrain()` runs the happy path after a response, but it is only an
 * optimization: retries, the §10.3 sequence's day-3/day-7 steps, and every cron
 * task exist solely because this endpoint is called. If nothing calls it, mail
 * still appears to work — right up until the first provider blip, which then never
 * recovers. That asymmetry is why CRON_SECRET's absence answers 404 loudly rather
 * than degrading quietly.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION: a bearer token, not a Vercel signature. Vercel Cron attaches
 * `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` automatically; a Docker sidecar, systemd
 * timer, or external pinger sends the identical header. ONE mechanism serves both
 * deploy targets — `x-vercel-signature` would make a critical path Vercel-only,
 * which spec 19.1 forbids.
 *
 * GET because that is what Vercel Cron issues. It mutates, which a GET should not,
 * and the mitigating fact is that it is not reachable without the secret and is
 * idempotent in effect (draining an empty queue is a no-op).
