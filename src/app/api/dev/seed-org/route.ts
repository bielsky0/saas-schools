/**
 * Test-only organization seeder (spec 14.1). Creates an org owned by an existing
 * seeded user and adds members with roles, without driving the UI — so RBAC and
 * context-switch E2E tests have deterministic fixtures. Disabled in production.
 *
 * Body: { ownerEmail, name?, slug?, subdomain?, timezone?, currency?,
 *         members?: [{ email, role }] }
 * All emails must already exist (seed them via /api/dev/seed-user first).
 *
 * `timezone`/`currency` fall back to constants here even though the production
 * path forbids a default (Constraint 5). That asymmetry is deliberate: the rule
 * exists so a human never creates an academy with a currency they did not look
 * at, and there is no human in a fixture. `subdomain` is different — it is
 * UNIQUE, so it is minted per call rather than defaulted, for the same reason
 * every spec mints a `uniqueEmail()`: the suite shares one database with no
 * teardown, and parallel workers would collide on a constant.

/**
 * Coerce a slug into a legal DNS label (D63, hardened in F4.6).
 *
 * A slug and a subdomain answer to different authorities, and the difference
 * only became load-bearing when the STAFF PANEL moved onto tenant hosts: an
 * academy whose subdomain is not a valid label is now unreachable altogether,
 * not merely missing a public site.
 *
 * The trap is specific and it has bitten before: `uniqueId()` from
 * billing-fixtures joins with UNDERSCORES, which `SUBDOMAIN_PATTERN` rejects, so
 * `parseHost` classifies such a host as `foreign` and every request answers 404
 * `unknown_organization`. The symptom (a broken tenant lookup) sits nowhere near
 * the cause (a fixture's id format), so this normalizes rather than trusting
 * callers to remember.
 *
 * Sanitizing here rather than rejecting is deliberate: the production path never
 * derives a subdomain from a slug at all — `createOrganizationAction` takes it as
 * a separate, required, `subdomainSchema`-validated field — so this is a
 * fixture-only convenience and refusing would only make specs restate the rule.
