/**
 * Test-only Row-Level Security probe (US-1.1/AC1). Disabled in production.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS AN ENDPOINT. AC1 says isolation must hold "even if the
 * application layer omits the filter". Every real `data.ts` function includes
 * that filter, so nothing in the app can demonstrate the property — a passing
 * test would only prove the filter works. The queries below therefore omit the
 * owner predicate DELIBERATELY. That is the whole point, and it is why they live
 * here and not in a feature module.
 *
 * `mode` selects who asks:
 *   "tenant"  → inside withTenant(organizationId) — expect only that org's rows
 *   "owner"   → inside withOwner(owner)           — either owner shape (F1a)
 *   "raw"     → no owner context at all           — expect ZERO rows
 *   "bypass"  → inside withSystemBypass()         — expect every owner's rows
 *
 * `action` selects what:
 *   "select"  → the unfiltered read described above
 *   "insert"  → write a row claiming `rowOwner` while acting as `owner`. When the
 *               two differ, WITH CHECK must reject it with SQLSTATE 42501. When
 *               they match it is the POSITIVE CONTROL — without which every
 *               refusal test would pass equally well against a policy that
 *               refuses everything — and doubles as the seeder for the
 *               account-owned rows the read tests need.
 *   "upsert"  → seed a `billing_customer` for `rowOwner`, then attempt an
 *               ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE onto it while acting as `owner` (F1b).
 *               Distinct from "insert" because Postgres treats the two conflict
 *               actions differently, and the difference is what makes the
 *               billing webhook safe — see the branch for the detail.
 *
 * The `environment` block is returned on every call and is the most important
 * part of the response. RLS is bypassed unconditionally by a superuser and by a
 * table owner without FORCE, so if the app connected as `postgres` the isolation
 * assertions would pass while proving nothing. `excluded` is asserted too, and
 * NEGATIVELY: those four tables must NOT have RLS, because enabling it on
 * `notification_preference` (keyed on the user, not an owner) would silently
 * stop in-app suppression from working. See that table's schema header.
