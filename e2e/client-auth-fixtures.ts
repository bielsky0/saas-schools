/**
 * Fixtures for parent authentication (langlion §2.19, plan F3).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CODE IS READ FROM THE EMAIL OUTBOX, NEVER FROM A FIXTURE ROUTE, and
 * that is a deliberate constraint rather than an inconvenience worked around. The
 * database stores only a SHA-256, so no endpoint could return the digits — and if
 * one could, every test using it would stop proving that a real parent can
 * actually receive a code. Reading the outbox exercises template rendering, job
 * enqueueing and the drain, which is most of the delivery half of US-4.5.
 *
 * ─── The academy is in the URL, not in the body (F4.5, closes D39) ──────────
 *
 * These used to post `{ subdomain, … }` to a relative path. The production
 * routes now take the academy from the `Host` header, so the fixtures address
 * the academy's host instead. `subdomain` stays a PARAMETER of each helper — it
 * moved from the payload to the URL, which is exactly the change production
 * made, so these still mirror the real contract.
 *
 * The `/api/dev/client-auth` helpers at the bottom are deliberately NOT changed:
 * see the note there.
