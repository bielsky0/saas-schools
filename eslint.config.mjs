  /**
   * Super-admin containment (spec 6.3).

   * Two things must not leak out of `src/features/admin`:

   *     and the audit write lives in `features/admin/actions.ts`. An import from
   *     anywhere else is an unaudited privileged action by construction.
   *   - `features/admin/data`: it queries business tables WITHOUT a tenant-owner
   *     filter (the §6.2 carve-out). Its access boundary is `requireSuperAdmin()`,
   *     which only its own callers apply — behind any other caller, the same
   *     query is a tenant-isolation breach.
   *
   * The rule is the enforcement, not the file headers that explain it. Note
   * `importNames`: plain `authAdapter` from the same module stays free.
   *
   * Exempt: the admin feature itself, the auth adapter that defines the export,
   * and the `(admin)` route group — the panel's own pages, which apply
   * `requireSuperAdmin()` as their first line and are the intended consumers.
   * Everything else in the app is denied by default.
   *
   * The group is matched as `src/app/**\/(admin)/**` rather than a fixed
   * `src/app/(admin)/**` so it survives a segment being added above it — §16 put
   * the whole page tree under `[locale]`, which silently un-exempted the panel and
   * failed CI until this pattern stopped hard-coding the depth. (A literal
   * `src/app/[locale]/...` would be worse than the depth: `[locale]` is a glob
   * CHARACTER CLASS, so it would match `/l/`, `/o/`, `/c/` … and not the directory
   * actually named `[locale]`.)

  /**
   * Fences around tenant-isolation bypasses (spec §1.3, Faza 30a).
   *
   * Four doors lead out of tenant-scoped access, and each must have an
   * exemption list you can grep:
   *
   *  1. `payload-config` — the Payload config passed to `getPayload()`.
   *     Allowed only in `tenant-payload.ts`, which wraps `getPayload` and
   *     exposes `tenantFind`/`tenantFindByID` that enforce `overrideAccess: false`.
   *
   *  2. `getPayload` from the `payload` package — the factory for a raw
   *     Payload instance whose `find`/`findByID` default to `overrideAccess: true`.
   *     Same exemption as #1.
   *
   *  3. `payload.db.drizzle` — Payload's Drizzle ORM handle, which bypasses
   *     Payload access control entirely. Same exemption as #1.
   *
   *  4. `@/lib/db/system` / `withSystemBypass` — turns RLS off for a
   *     transaction. Its exemptions are the cross-tenant paths that
   *     genuinely cannot name a tenant:
   *
   *        - `features/organizations/cross-tenant.ts` — the account switcher
   *          spans orgs by definition, and an invitation's org is unknown
   *          until its token hash resolves. Deliberately a separate file from
   *          `./data.ts`, so the exemption does not also cover `getMembership`
   *          / `listMembers`.
   *        - `features/admin/data.ts` — the super-admin panel reads membership
   *          across every tenant; the §6.2 carve-out that already fences this
   *          module.
   *        - `features/admin/actions.ts` — user hard-delete removes that user's
   *          membership in every org they belong to (§11.3): one statement,
   *          no owner.
   *        - `features/storage/purge.ts` — the retention cron sweeps
   *          soft-deleted files for all owners. The bypass covers ONLY
   *          `listPurgeableFiles`; each `hardDeleteFile` re-enters the context
   *          of its own row's owner.
   *        - `features/onboarding/data.ts` — `hasPaidSubscription` answers
   *          "is this person paying anywhere", joining membership across every
   *          org; the input is a user id, not an owner.
   *        - `features/credits/expire.ts` (F4) — credits lapse on their own
   *          clock in every academy at once, so the work list cannot name a
   *          tenant. The bypass covers ONLY that read; each update re-enters
   *          its rows' own organization, so WITH CHECK stays load-bearing
   *          where a mix-up would destroy paid-for value. Same narrow shape
   *          as `storage/purge.ts` above.
   *        - `features/billing/cross-tenant.ts` (F1b) — a provider webhook
   *          learns which tenant an event belongs to by resolving its customer
   *          id; the owner is the OUTPUT of that lookup, so there is nothing
   *          to scope by until it returns. Deliberately a separate file from
   *          `./data.ts` AND from `./webhooks.ts`, so the exemption covers
   *          neither the tenant-scoped reads nor the two upserts whose
   *          `WITH CHECK` is the last line on the only externally-driven
   *          write path in the application.
   *
   *  Also exempt: `src/app/api/dev/**`. Every dev route can bypass RLS. They
   *  404 in production, and the RLS probe needs the bypass to assert what the
   *  policies hide — but a reader counting bullets should not have to infer
   *  this one.
   *
   * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT EXEMPT, so a reviewer does not add it out of
   * sympathy:
   *  - `features/billing/data.ts` — `resolveBillingRecipients` takes an
   *    `organizationId` parameter, so it scopes itself with `withTenant`;
   *    its one cross-tenant read moved out to `./cross-tenant.ts` in F1b.
   *  - `features/billing/webhooks.ts` — it resolves its owner through
   *    `./cross-tenant.ts` first, then writes inside `withOwner`, so the
   *    policy stays load-bearing on the write path.
   *  - `features/organizations/actions.ts` — `acceptInvitation` resolves the
   *    org through `cross-tenant.ts` first, then writes inside `withTenant`,
   *    so the policy stays load-bearing on the write path.
   *  - `features/organizations/context.ts` — `requireOrgAccess` is per-request
   *    and uses `withTenant`; routing it here would emit a warn on every
   *    authenticated request and drown the signal this fence exists to keep
   *    countable.
   *  - `lib/adapters/auth/better-auth.ts` — its hooks touch `personal_account`
   *    and `user` only, neither under RLS.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: This is a SINGLE block despite the two concerns, because
   * ESLint flat config replaces the entire rule value when a later block
   * also sets `no-restricted-imports`. Keeping them separate would silently
   * drop one set of restrictions. (Faza 30-spike discovered this the hard
   * way.)
